# CREATE Vivid 2017

## Total Code base for Create Vivid 2017 "Crystallise"

### [Code](https://github.com/will-weng/vivid17/tree/master/Code)

Graphing library in C

### [Code 2.0](https://github.com/will-weng/vivid17/tree/master/Code%202.0)

Graphing library in C++, used for microcontroller

### [Simulator](https://github.com/will-weng/vivid17/tree/master/Simulator)

Mosaic simulator in C++, used to simulate Arduino code (with minimal modification) to see results without actual hardware present. Only insert code into the "Code to simulate" section (marked out clearly) in main.cpp, run/compile using ./compile_run (optionally just run with ./run). Terminal outputs fps information. Dynamic performance adjustments are disabled (very broken and unnecessary).

### [Lighting pattern](https://github.com/will-weng/vivid17/tree/master/lighting_patterns)

Running light patterns for arduino and led
