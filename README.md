# CREATE Vivid 2017

## Total Code base for Create Vivid 2017 "Crystallise"

### [Simulator](https://github.com/will-weng/vivid17/tree/master/Simulator)

Mosaic simulator in C++, used to simulate Arduino code (with minimal modification) to see results without actual hardware present. 
<p>
<b>Make a copy of main.cpp and name it to reflect the pattern it tests.</b>
<p>
Only insert code into the "Code to simulate" sections (one for multithreaded code, and another for singlethreaded code, marked out clearly) in {your main}.cpp, run/compile using ./compile_run {your main.cpp} (optionally just run with ./run), where {your main.cpp} is an argument taken in. 
<p>
Use "disp.wait({nanoseconds})" to control the speed of your animation.
<p>
Terminal outputs fps information. Dynamic performance adjustments are disabled (very broken and unnecessary).
