Mosaic simulator in C++, used to simulate Arduino code (with minimal modification) to see results without actual hardware present. 

Make a copy of main.cpp and name it to reflect the pattern it tests.

Only insert code into the "Code to simulate" sections (one for multithreaded code, and another for singlethreaded code, marked out clearly) in {your main}.cpp, run/compile using ./compile_run {your main.cpp} (optionally just run with ./run), where {your main.cpp} is an argument taken in. 

Use "disp.wait({nanoseconds})" to control the speed of your animation.

Terminal outputs fps information. Dynamic performance adjustments are disabled (very broken and unnecessary).
