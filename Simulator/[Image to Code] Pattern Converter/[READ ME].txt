Copy Template.bmp and paste into your preferred image editor, and colour in the appropriate panels. When done, run:

 ./compile_run yourImage.bmp

 replacing yourImage.bmp with whatever you named the image containing your pattern. Some text will then be outputted to the command line, along with the same text into a file called yourImage.bmp (or whatever you named your image).

 This text is what the code for the controller uses to create the pattern (and the simulator). Verify that it all works by loading it into the simulator.

 Format of output text:
 {{R0,G0,B0},{R1,G1,B1}, ... {RN,GN,BN}};
 where Rn is how much red should be in crystal n,
       Gn is how much green should be in crystal n, and
       Bn is how much blue should be in crystal n. 

These values range from 0 to 255.
