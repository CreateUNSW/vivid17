Copy Template.bmp and paste into your preferred image editor, and colour in the appropriate panels. When done, run:

 ./compile_run yourImage.bmp

 replacing yourImage.bmp with whatever you named the image containing your pattern. Some text will then be outputted to the command line, along with the same text into a file called yourImage.bmp (or whatever you named your image).

 This text is what the code for the controller uses to create the pattern (and the simulator). Verify that it all works by loading it into the simulator.

 Format of output text:
 {{id1 of crystal in wing},{id2 of crystal in wing}, ... {idN of crystal in wing}};

There is also a reciprocate file (of crystals NOT in wing generated).
These output both to file, and to command line.

NOTE: .bmp files must be in 24-bit format, do not overwrite colour space information when saving your image from the provided Template.bmp
